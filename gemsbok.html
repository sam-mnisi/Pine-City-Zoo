                       <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                       <p>Gemsbok are large antelopes of the genus Oryx, native to arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly the Kalahari Desert. The most well-known species is Oryx gazella, distinguished by its striking black-and-white facial markings and long, straight horns which both males and females possess. Gemsbok are superbly adapted to desert environments, capable of surviving high temperatures and limited water availability. They often get moisture from the plants they consume, such as wild melons and roots.</p>
     <p>Gemsbok are social animals and typically form herds of 10â€“40 individuals. Their muscular build and defensive horns make them formidable against predators like lions and hyenas. These antelopes can run at high speeds and are known for their strength and endurance.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen A14, across from the Desert Habitat Pavilion.</p>
