                       <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                       <p>Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) are the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. Native to the savannahs and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, giraffes are best known for their extraordinarily long necks, which can be up to 2.4 m (8 ft) in length. Despite having only seven neck vertebrae—the same number as most mammals—their vertebrae are greatly elongated.</p>
     <p>Giraffes use their height to browse leaves and buds from high trees, primarily acacias. They have distinctive coat patterns that vary between subspecies. Socially, giraffes form loose, open herds and use their height to spot predators such as lions from a distance.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen C7, near the central viewing platform.</p>
