                       <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                       <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling great apes found in the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. There are two species: the eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei) and the western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), each with further subspecies. Gorillas are the largest living primates, with adult males, known as silverbacks, weighing up to 180 kg (400 lb).</p>
     <p>Gorillas live in stable family groups led by a dominant silverback. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo shoots. Despite their formidable appearance, gorillas are generally gentle and intelligent animals, capable of using tools and exhibiting complex social behaviors.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen F3, adjacent to the Tropical Forest Dome.</p>
