                       <h3>KOALA</h3>
                       <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is a marsupial native to Australia, commonly found in eucalyptus forests along the eastern and southern coasts. Despite often being called “koala bears,” they are not bears but belong to a unique group of arboreal marsupials.</p>
     <p>Koalas have a highly specialized diet, feeding almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and toxic to most animals. They sleep up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy. Koalas have strong limbs and curved claws to grip tree trunks and branches efficiently.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen B11, just past the Australian Outback exhibit.</p>
