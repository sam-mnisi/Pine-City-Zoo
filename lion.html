                       <h3>LION</h3>
                       <p>Lions (Panthera leo) are large carnivorous mammals of the family Felidae and are often referred to as “the king of the jungle.” They are found primarily in savannahs and grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population of Asiatic lions living in India’s Gir Forest.</p>
     <p>Lions are unique among cats for their social structure; they live in groups called prides, usually consisting of related females, their cubs, and a few males. Male lions are recognizable by their thick manes, which vary in color and size. Lions are apex predators and primarily hunt large herbivores.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions at pen D9, near the Safari Trail entrance.</p>
