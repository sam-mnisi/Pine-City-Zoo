                       <h3>PANDA</h3>
                       <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear native to south-central China. Known for their distinctive black-and-white coloring, pandas are primarily solitary and spend most of their time foraging for bamboo, which makes up over 99% of their diet.</p>
     <p>Pandas have a special wrist bone that functions as a thumb, enabling them to grasp bamboo stalks. Despite being classified as carnivores, they have adapted to a herbivorous diet. Pandas are a global symbol of wildlife conservation due to their vulnerability and limited natural habitat.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the pandas at pen G8, near the Asian Highlands exhibit.</p>
