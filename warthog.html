                       <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                       <p>Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are wild members of the pig family found in grasslands, savannahs, and woodlands throughout sub-Saharan Africa. They are recognizable by their large, curved tusks and facial "warts"â€”protective bumps of thickened skin.</p>
     <p>Warthogs are omnivores and graze on grasses, roots, and small animals. They often use abandoned aardvark burrows for shelter and will enter backward to defend themselves with their tusks facing out. Despite their bulky appearance, warthogs can run fast when threatened.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the warthogs at pen A18, just past the African Plains boardwalk.</p>
